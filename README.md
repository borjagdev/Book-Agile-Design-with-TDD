# Following *Diseño Ágil con TDD*
## Introduction
This repository is a compilation of tested examples I made following the book *[Diseño Ágil con TDD](https://leanpub.com/tdd-en-castellano)*, the first book about TDD written in Spanish.
Read the book and support the writer!

All the code is written in Java, tested with JUnit's AssertJ library.
Generated as a Maven project.
